# Angular Medium

1. **What is lazy loading in Angular and why is it important?**
   -  Lazy loading is a technique in Angular where modules are loaded only when they are needed, reducing the initial loading time of an application. This is crucial for improving application performance, particularly in large applications, as it allows for smaller initial bundles and faster load times for users.

2. **Describe Angular change detection and its default behavior.**
   -  Angular change detection is the process of identifying and propagating changes to the application's view. By default, Angular uses a top-down approach where it checks all components and their child components for changes in a continuous loop. When a change is detected, Angular updates the view to reflect the new data.

3. **Explain the role of ngZone in Angular.**
   -  `NgZone` is a core part of Angular that helps manage asynchronous operations. It provides a way to run code in the Angular zone, ensuring proper change detection and a seamless user experience. It's especially useful for handling events and external libraries that are not aware of Angular's change detection.

4. **What is the purpose of Angular pipes, and how can you create a custom pipe?**
   -  Angular pipes are used for transforming data in the template. They provide a convenient way to format, filter, and manipulate data before it's displayed. To create a custom pipe, you implement the `PipeTransform` interface and define the `transform` method in your TypeScript code. Then, you can use the custom pipe in your templates.

5. **What is NgRx, and how does it relate to state management in Angular?**
   -  NgRx is a state management library for Angular applications. It's based on the Redux pattern and provides a central store for managing the application's state. NgRx helps manage complex data flows and state changes in a predictable and centralized way, making it easier to build and maintain large applications.

6. **Describe the Angular component lifecycle hooks.**
   -  Angular component lifecycle hooks are methods that are called at different stages of a component's life, such as `ngOnInit`, `ngOnChanges`, `ngAfterViewInit`, etc. They allow developers to perform actions at specific points in a component's lifecycle, like initializing data, subscribing to observables, or cleaning up resources.

7. **How can you share data between sibling components in Angular?**
   -  Data can be shared between sibling components in Angular by using a shared service. The service holds the shared data, and the components can communicate with the service to retrieve or update the data. This approach promotes data separation and keeps components independent.

8. **What is Angular testing, and how do you write unit tests for components?**
   -  Angular testing involves writing unit tests to verify that components, services, and other parts of the application work correctly. To write unit tests for components, you can use tools like Jasmine and Karma or Angular's `TestBed`. You create test cases, provide necessary dependencies, and make assertions to ensure the component behaves as expected.

9. **What is AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation in Angular?**
   -  Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation is a process in Angular where the application is compiled and optimized at build time, as opposed to Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation, which happens at runtime. AOT compilation improves performance by reducing the size of the application's JavaScript bundles and detecting template errors early.

10. **How can you implement internationalization (i18n) in an Angular application?**
    -  Internationalization in Angular can be implemented using the `@angular/localize` package. It allows you to mark translatable text, extract those texts, translate them into different languages, and load the appropriate translations based on the user's language preference.


11. **Describe the Angular FormBuilder and reactive forms.**
    -  The Angular `FormBuilder` is a service that simplifies the creation of reactive forms in Angular applications. Reactive forms provide a way to manage and validate user input in a more structured manner. You can create form controls, form groups, and form arrays using `FormBuilder`. It helps with dynamic form creation, validation, and handling user input events.

12. **Explain Angular animations and how to use them.**
    -  Angular animations are a set of tools for animating elements and transitions in an Angular application. You can use animations to add visual feedback and create smooth transitions. Animations can be applied to components, elements, and routes. To use Angular animations, you define triggers, states, transitions, and animations in component metadata and apply them in templates.

13. **What is server-side rendering (SSR) in Angular?**
    -  Server-side rendering (SSR) in Angular is a technique that involves rendering Angular applications on the server rather than in the browser. It generates pre-rendered HTML pages that can be delivered to the client. SSR is essential for improving search engine optimization (SEO), initial load times, and providing better support for social sharing and web crawlers.

14. **How can you secure an Angular application?**
    -  Securing an Angular application involves implementing authentication, authorization, and other security measures. You can use tools like JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication, guard routes, and implement role-based access control. It's crucial to validate user input, sanitize data, and protect against common web vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

15. **What are Angular Elements, and how do they work?**
    -  Angular Elements are a feature that allows you to package Angular components as web components, which can be used in non-Angular applications. They are standalone, self-contained elements that can be included in any HTML page using custom elements. To create Angular Elements, you need to build your Angular components with the `@angular/elements` package and package them as a custom element.

16. **Explain Angular Universal and its use cases.**
    -  Angular Universal is a technology that enables server-side rendering (SSR) for Angular applications. It allows Angular applications to run on the server, generating HTML on the server side and delivering pre-rendered pages to the client. Use cases for Angular Universal include improving SEO, speeding up initial load times, and enhancing the user experience, particularly for progressive web apps (PWAs).

17. **How do you optimize the size of the Angular bundle for faster loading?**
    -  Optimizing the size of the Angular bundle can be achieved through various techniques such as tree shaking, code splitting, lazy loading, and minification. Tree shaking removes unused code, code splitting divides the bundle into smaller parts, lazy loading loads only what's needed, and minification reduces the size of code and assets.

18. **Describe Angular decorators such as @ViewChild, @ContentChild, @HostBinding, and @HostListener.**
    -  Angular decorators are used to modify the behavior of classes, properties, methods, or parameters. These specific decorators have the following purposes:
       - `@ViewChild` and `@ContentChild`: These decorators are used to access child elements or components within a parent component.
       - `@HostBinding`: It binds an element property or attribute to a host element property.
       - `@HostListener`: It allows you to listen for events on a host element and trigger actions in your component.

19. **What are Angular schematics, and how can they be customized?**
    -  Angular schematics are code generators that help create or modify Angular files and code structures. They can be customized to match specific project requirements. You can create custom schematics or use existing ones provided by the Angular CLI. Customization involves defining templates, schematics options, and applying them to generate or modify code.

20. **How do you handle nested routes in Angular Routing?**
    -  Handling nested routes in Angular involves defining child routes within a parent route configuration. Child routes are configured as an array within the parent route's configuration. When navigating to a child route, Angular will render the corresponding components within the parent's `<router-outlet>`. This allows for a hierarchical structure of routes and views.
