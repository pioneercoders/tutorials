## Basic HTML Questions

1. **What is HTML?**
   - HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language for creating web pages.

2. **What are the basic structure and syntax of an HTML document?**
   - An HTML document consists of elements enclosed in tags. It typically includes an opening `<html>` tag, a `<head>` section for meta-information, and a `<body>` section for the content.

3. **Explain the difference between HTML and XHTML.**
   - HTML is more forgiving of errors in markup, while XHTML follows stricter rules and is based on XML syntax.

4. **What is an HTML element?**
   - An HTML element is a building block of an HTML document, defined by tags. It can represent text, images, links, and more.

5. **What is an HTML attribute?**
   - An HTML attribute provides additional information about an element and is specified within the element's opening tag.

## HTML Tags and Elements

6. **What is the purpose of the `<head>` section in an HTML document?**
   - The `<head>` section contains meta-information about the document, such as the title, character encoding, and linked stylesheets or scripts.

7. **Explain the difference between block-level and inline elements. Give examples of each.**
   - Block-level elements create a new block formatting context and typically start on a new line (e.g., `<div>`, `<p>`). Inline elements do not start on a new line and flow within the content (e.g., `<span>`, `<a>`).
