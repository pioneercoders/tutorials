# Angular Simple

1. **What is Angular?**
   - Angular is a popular open-source JavaScript framework for building web applications. It allows developers to create dynamic, single-page web applications with a modular and component-based architecture.

2. **Explain the difference between AngularJS and Angular.**
    - AngularJS, often referred to as Angular 1.x, is an older version of the framework. Angular, also known as Angular 2+ or just Angular, is a complete rewrite and has significant differences. Angular is component-based, uses TypeScript, and provides better performance and tooling.

3. **What are the key features of Angular?**
   -  Key features of Angular include two-way data binding, dependency injection, component-based architecture, TypeScript support, and a robust CLI for scaffolding and building applications.

4. **How do you create a new Angular project?**
   -  You can create a new Angular project using Angular CLI by running `ng new project-name` in the command line.

5. **What is data binding in Angular?**
   -  Data binding in Angular allows you to establish a connection between the view and the component's data. There are four types of data binding: interpolation, property binding, event binding, and two-way binding.

6. **Explain Angular modules.**
   -  Angular modules (NgModule) are used to organize an Angular application into functional units. They declare what components, directives, services, and pipes belong to the module and allow for better modularity and reusability.

7. **What is an Angular component?**
   -  An Angular component is a building block of an application that encapsulates the template, data, and logic. It is used to create reusable and self-contained parts of the user interface.

8. **How do you pass data from parent to child components?**
   -  Data can be passed from a parent to a child component using input properties. The child component defines an `@Input` decorator for a property, and the parent component binds the data to that property in the template.

9. **What is ngIf and how is it used?**
   - `ngIf` is a structural directive in Angular used for conditionally rendering or removing elements from the DOM based on a specified expression. For example, `<div *ngIf="showElement">Content</div>`.

10. **What is ngFor and how is it used?**
    -  `ngFor` is a structural directive used for iterating over a collection, such as an array or list, and generating HTML for each item. For example, `<li *ngFor="let item of items">{{ item }}</li>`.


11. **What is Angular CLI, and what is its purpose?**
    -  Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a command-line tool provided by the Angular team to simplify various development tasks. Its purpose is to help developers create, manage, and build Angular applications more efficiently. It provides commands for project scaffolding, generating components, services, modules, and much more. It also assists in running development servers, testing, and building production-ready applications.

12. **How do you handle user input in Angular?**
    -  In Angular, you handle user input through event binding and template-driven forms or reactive forms. Event binding allows you to capture user events like clicks, keypresses, or form submissions and trigger corresponding actions in your components. For forms, template-driven forms use two-way data binding for simpler forms, while reactive forms offer a more powerful and flexible way to manage complex forms with validation.

13. **What is the Angular CLI command to generate a new component?**
    -  The Angular CLI command to generate a new component is `ng generate component component-name`, where `component-name` is the name of the component you want to create. This command will create the necessary component files and add it to the app module.

14. **What is Angular Routing, and how does it work?**
    -  Angular Routing is a mechanism for navigating between different parts of an Angular application without having to make full page requests. It works by defining routes in the application and associating each route with a specific component. When a user clicks a link or enters a URL, Angular's router takes care of loading the appropriate component and updating the view.

15. **Explain Angular services.**
    -  Angular services are classes that are used to encapsulate and provide shared functionality or data across multiple components. They are typically used to perform tasks such as making HTTP requests, sharing data between components, and abstracting business logic. Services are injected into components via dependency injection and are often decorated with the `@Injectable` decorator.

16. **What is Dependency Injection in Angular?**
    -  Dependency Injection (DI) in Angular is a design pattern and a core concept that allows components and services to declare their dependencies rather than creating them. Angular's DI system provides these dependencies, promoting modularity and making it easier to test and maintain the code. Dependencies are typically provided as constructor parameters in components and services.

17. **How can you make an HTTP GET request in Angular?**
    -  To make an HTTP GET request in Angular, you can use the Angular `HttpClient` module. First, you need to import `HttpClientModule` in your app module. Then, you can inject `HttpClient` into a service or component and use its `get()` method to make a GET request to a specified URL. You can subscribe to the Observable it returns to handle the response.

18. **What are Angular directives, and what are their types?**
    -  Angular directives are markers on DOM elements that tell Angular to perform certain behavior or apply specific styles. There are three main types of Angular directives:
       - **Component Directives:** These create and manage components.
       - **Structural Directives:** These change the structure of the DOM, such as `*ngFor` and `*ngIf`.
       - **Attribute Directives:** These change the appearance or behavior of an element, such as `ngClass` and `ngStyle`.

19. **Explain Angular decorators.**
    -  Angular decorators are functions that modify the behavior of classes, properties, methods, or parameters. They are often used to configure and enhance various aspects of an Angular application. For example, `@Component` is a decorator used to define components, `@Injectable` is used to mark a class as injectable for DI, and `@Input` is used to indicate an input property in a component.

20. **How do you handle errors in Angular HTTP requests?**
    -  Errors in Angular HTTP requests can be handled by subscribing to the `Observable` returned by the HTTP request and using the `catchError` operator from the `rxjs` library. You can define error-handling logic within the `catchError` operator to handle and log errors or perform specific actions when an HTTP request fails.
