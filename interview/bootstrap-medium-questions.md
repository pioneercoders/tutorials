#### 1. What is the key difference between S3 and EBS in AWS
  Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is object storage used for storing and retrieving data, while Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) provides block storage that's typically used for attaching to EC2 instances as storage volumes. EBS is suitable for databases and applications that require file systems.
  
#### 2. What is the difference between EC2 and ECS in the context of containerized applications?
  Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a service for launching virtual machines where you manage the entire infrastructure, while Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) is a container orchestration service for running and managing Docker containers, abstracting much of the infrastructure management for containerized applications.
  
#### 3. How can you improve the security of data in transit in AWS?
  To improve the security of data in transit, you can use techniques like enabling SSL/TLS encryption for communication, using Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and network security groups to control access, and implementing AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) and AWS Shield for protection against DDoS attacks.
  
#### 4. What is the AWS Shared Responsibility Model, and how does it apply to security?
  The AWS Shared Responsibility Model defines security responsibilities between AWS and the customer. AWS is responsible for the security "of" the cloud, meaning the infrastructure and physical security. The customer is responsible for the security "in" the cloud, which includes securing their applications, data, and access control.
  
#### 5. What is Amazon VPC Peering, and when would you use it?
  Amazon VPC Peering is a network connection between two VPCs that allows resources in one VPC to communicate with resources in another VPC. It's typically used when you need to establish connectivity between different VPCs within the same or different AWS accounts while keeping them logically isolated.
  
#### 6. What is AWS Lambda@Edge, and how does it work?
  AWS Lambda@Edge is a service that lets you run Lambda functions at AWS edge locations. It's designed for customizing and enhancing content delivery and security with AWS CloudFront. Lambda@Edge allows you to execute code in response to events generated by CloudFront distributions at edge locations.
  
#### 7.  Explain AWS Identity Federation and its benefits.
  AWS Identity Federation is a way to allow external identities (e.g., from Active Directory, SAML-based identity providers) to access AWS resources. It benefits organizations by centralizing identity management and allowing users to access AWS services using their existing corporate credentials.
  
#### 8. How can you ensure high availability for your application in AWS?
  To ensure high availability, you can distribute your application across multiple Availability Zones (AZ's), use load balancing, implement Auto Scaling, and set up failover mechanisms. You can also leverage services like Amazon RDS Multi-AZ for database redundancy.
  
#### 9. What is AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and how does it differ from other AWS services like EC2 and ECS?
  AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that simplifies deploying and managing web applications. It abstracts the infrastructure management and allows you to focus on your code. EC2 and ECS, on the other hand, provide more control over the infrastructure and are suitable for a wider range of application types.
  
#### 10. What is AWS CloudTrail, and why is it important for security and compliance?
  AWS CloudTrail is a service that records API calls made on your AWS account. It is crucial for security and compliance because it provides a detailed history of actions, allowing you to monitor changes, investigate security incidents, and meet compliance requirements by tracking who did what, when, and where.
  
#### 11. How can you optimize AWS costs for your infrastructure?
  To optimize AWS costs, you can use services like AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Budgets to monitor and set budgets. Employ resource tagging, right-sizing of instances, and reserved instances for predictable workloads. Additionally, enable Auto Scaling and use spot instances to take advantage of cost savings opportunities.
